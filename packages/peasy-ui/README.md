# Peasy UI

This is the repository for Peasy UI, a small-ish and relatively easy to use UI binding library.

## Introduction

Peasy UI provides uncomplicated UI bindings for HTML via string templating. It's intended to be used in vanilla JavaScript/Typescript projects where using `createElement` is too cumbersome and adding a complete SPA framework is overkill or simply not desired. Thanks to the small scope of the library, performance is decent.

## First look

In Peasy UI, an HTML template is combined with a JavaScript/Typescript object, the model, into a `UI View` that's added to an element. Peasy UI will then sync state between the UI and the model according to the one-way, two-way and event bindings. For a more exact control over when the state is synced, the `update()` method can be called manually, typically after updating the model or in a recurring (game) loop, .

```ts
const template = `
    Color: <input \${value <=> color}>
    <span style="background-color: \${color}">\${color}</span>
    <button \${click @=> clicked}>Gold</button>
    `;

const model = {
    color: 'red';
    clicked: () => model.color = 'gold';
};

const view = UI.create(document.body, template, model);
```
This example creates a two-way bound input field where whatever color is typed in is displayed in a span with that background color. When the button Gold is clicked, the click event binding will update the color property in the model which in turn will update all bindings in the view.

## Getting started

If you've got a build process and are using npm, install Peasy UI with

    npm i @peasy-lib/peasy-ui

and `import` it into whichever files you want to use it

```ts
import { UI } from '@peasy-lib/peasy-ui';
```

If you don't have a build process or don't want to install it, use a `script` tag of type `module` and import from `https://cdn.skypack.dev/@peasy-lib/peasy-ui` instead.

```html
<html>
<body>
  <script type="module">
    import { UI } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@peasy-lib/peasy-ui";

    const template = '<div>${greeting} (Been running for ${timer} seconds.)</div>';
    const model = { greeting: 'Hello, World!', timer: -1 };
    UI.create(document.body, template, model);

    setInterval(() => {
      model.timer++;
    }, 1000);
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Features and syntax

Peasy UI uses the JavaScript/Typescript string interpolation syntax of `${ }` in combination with different versions of the spaceship operator `<=>` to bind between an `attribute` on the element and a `property` on the model.

```ts
'Color: <input ${value <=> color}>' // Two-way binding between value attribute and color property
```
### Available bindings

    ${attr <== prop}    Bindning from model property to element attribute
    ${attr <=| prop}    One-time bindning from model property to element attribute
    ${attr ==> prop}    Bindning from element attribute to model property
    ${attr <=> prop}    Two-way binding between element attribute and model property

    ${prop}             Bindning from model property to attribute or text
    ${|prop}            One-time bindning from model property to attribute or text

    ${event @=> method} Event bindning from element attribute to model method

    ${'value' ==> prop} Binding from element to model property, used to bind
                        values of radio buttons and select inputs to a model property

    ${ ==> prop}        One-time binding that stores the element in model property

    ${ === prop}        Binding that renders the element if model property is not false
                        and not nullish
    ${ !== prop}        Binding that renders the element if model property is false or
                        nullish

    ${alias <=* list(:key)} Bindning from model list property to view template
                            alias for each item in the list. If key is provided
                            property key will be used to decide item equality

    ${comp === (state)} Binding that renders component (property with type or instance)
                        with a template and passes state, if component type, to
                        component's create method

A combination of the string value binding and a binding for the `change` event can be used to capture and react to changes in radio buttons and selects.

```ts
const template = `
    <input type="radio" \${'red' ==> color} \${change @=> changedColor}> Red
    <input type="radio" \${'green' ==> color} \${change @=> changedColor}> Green
    `;
const model = {
    color: 'red';
    changedColor: (event, model) => alert(`Changed color to ${model.color}.`),
};
```

```ts
const template = `
    <select \${change @=> changedColor}>
        <option \${'red' ==> color}>Red</option>
        <option \${'green' ==> color}>Green</option>
    </select>
    `;
const model = {
    color: 'red';
    changedColor: (event, model) => alert(`Changed color to ${model.color}.`),
};
```

```ts
const template = `
    <div \${ === preferCats}>I prefer cats.</div>
    <div \${ !== preferDogs}>I DON'T prefer dogs.</div>
`;
const model = { preferCats: true, preferDogs: false };
```


```ts
const template = `<div \${item <=* list}>Item: \${item}</div>`;
const model = { list: ['one', 'two', 'three'] };
```

```ts
const template = `<div \${object <=* list}>Item: \${object.id}</div>`;
const model = { list: [{ id: 'one' }, { id: 'two' }, { id: 'three' }] };
```

```ts
const template = `<div \${object <=* list:id}>Item: \${object.id}</div>`;
const model = { list: [{ id: 'one' }, { id: 'two' }, { id: 'three' }] };
```

```ts
class Greeting {
  // Queried by parent to create markup
  public static template = '<div>Hello, ${name}</div>';

  // Called by parent to create model
  public static create(state: { name: string }): Greeting {
    return new Greeting(state.name);
  }

  public constructor(public name: string) { }
}

const template = `<div>
        <\${Greeting === greet} \${greet <=* greets}>
        <\${greetObject === }>
    </div>`;
const model = { Greeting,
                greets: [{ name: 'World' }, { name: 'Everyone' }],
                greetObject: { template: '<div>Hello, ${name}</div>', name: 'Someone' } };
```

### Additional features

#### Awaiting animations

Peasy UI will not detach/remove an `UIView` with elements that have an active animation on them, so there's no need to await the end of any removal activations before destroying an `UIView`.

#### Control updates

Peasy UI will by default use `requestAnimationFrame` for updates. By calling `UI.initialize` before any other `UI` method a number can be provided to set updates per second or `false` to prevent Peasy UI from doing any automatic updates at all.

```ts
UI.initialize(false);

const tick = () => {
    doSomething();
    UI.update();
    doSomethingElse();
    requestAnimationFrame(tick);
}
requestAnimationFrame(tick);
```
